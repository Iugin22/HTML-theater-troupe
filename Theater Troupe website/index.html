            <p>
                Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe has been providing training, employment and performance
                opportunities for multiethnic and underserved artists since 1970 and acts to make
                significant contributions toward fostering the arts, specifically theater, within the
                State of Arizona. It operates to enhance the cultural and artistic awareness of the
                community by providing productions that illuminate the African-American experience and
                culture. It is our purpose and mission to educate, enlighten, and entertain a
                diverse, multicultural audience by using local, regional and national talent with
                the emphasis on providing exposure to black culture and ideology.
